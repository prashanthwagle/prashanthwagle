## What's up!

I'm Prashanth, a full-stack engineer, community learner, GenAI tinkerer, and someone who *really* likes turning messy problems into clean, scalable code.

## What does my weekdays and weekends look like?

I currently work on enterprise-grade .NET systems, but I’m equally fluent in Java, Spring Boot, and React. I'm especially passionate about using **Generative AI** to boost dev productivity, streamline workflows, and cut down noise in the software lifecycle.

On the side, I’m usually experimenting with something new—be it AI-powered side projects, open-source contributions, or just automating boring stuff for fun.

I love to be outside atleast for a couple of hours. I go on 5K runs every week, bike around various trails and invest a healthy amount of time for making my mind and body healthy.

## What drives me?

- Learning *every single day*—whether it’s a newsletter deep-dive, a new design pattern, or a Reddit thread on system design.
- Meeting smart, curious people. I attend and host meetups around data, software systems, and AI. If you’re in the DMV area and talk code, I probably want to grab coffee with you.
- Sharing what I learn. Whether it's a casual Slack convo, a LinkedIn post, or a stack of bookmarks—if it helped me, I’ll probably bring it up in the next conversation.

## Quick background

- Bachelor’s in Information Science & Engineering
- Master’s in Computer Science from University of Virginia (GPA: 3.97/4.00)
- 3+ years of experience solving business problems with tech (and sometimes solving tech problems with business sense)
- I like balancing depth and speed, shipping quickly, but with structure and patterns that make scaling easier

## My Tech Stack

**Languages**: C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript  
**Frameworks**: ASP.NET Core, Spring Boot, React, Redux, Spring Security  
**Databases**: SQL Server, DynamoDB, EF Core, Hibernate, JPA  
**Tools**: GitFlow, AWS (SageMaker, SQS), Docker, NuGet, npm, Agile, CI/CD, JSON, XML  
**Bonus Joys**: Java Streams, LINQ, debugging race conditions at 11pm (or when I reach a point where I feel confident of restarting without hassles the next day)

## Let’s connect

DMs always open on LinkedIn.  
Better yet, [book a 15-min coffee chat](#) and tell me what you’re learning or building—whether it's super niche or changing the world.  
Just let me know if you want to keep it open-ended, specific, or somewhere in between!

## Side note
I used to use "--" a lot before while writing, and this was before generative AI became mainstream!
