## 🔭 About me
You can usually spot me in the Brown Library at the University of Virginia, where I'm stationed like a java-fueled sentry in one of the cozy coffee pods. My day-to-day involves typing feverishly on my keyboard to make those sweet, sweet lines of code. 



## 🌱 What I do?

I'm a full-stack web wizard with skills that would make even Dumbledore jealous! My toolkit includes JavaScript for web software development, Python for serverless scripting, and Amazon Web Services for all your architecting and development needs.

## 🔬 What am I up to these days?

I've been a busy bee buzzing around an exciting new project: building an open-source software for creating low-code, web-based dashboards in R. I also utilize my time in exploring other fields which pique my interest.



## 🛠️ Things that I have worked on during my time as a developer
